# README

Custom code used to process data for the analysis entitled "The Land-energy-water nexus of global bioenergy potentials from abandoned cropland."

Modules refer to:
1. Process land cover data (ESA CCI-LC) to quantify cropland abandonment.
2. Integrate multiple datasets and methods to quantify 298 different global bioenergy potentials on recently abandoned cropland, and key nexus indicators.
3. Compare FAO statistics with ESA CCI-LC.

Custom code is memory intensive, and has been run on a server with 1 TB RAM.

Processed datasets are obtainable as referenced in the article (url: *manuscript under revision*).

See individual readme files for further information.
