# README

Custom code used to process data for the analysis entitled "The Land-energy-water nexus of global bioenergy potentials from abandoned cropland."

Modules refer to:
1. Process land cover data (ESA CCI-LC) to quantify cropland abandonment.
2. Integrate multiple datasets and methods to quantify global bioenergy potentials on recently abandoned cropland under the land-energy-water nexus.
3. Compare FAO statistics with ESA CCI-LC.

Custom code is memory intensive, and has been run on a server with 1 TB RAM.

Processed datasets are obtainable as referenced in the article (url: *manuscript under revision*).

See individual readme files for further information.
