# README

Custom code used to process data for the analysis entitled "The Land-energy-water nexus of global bioenergy potentials from abandoned cropland."

Modules refer to:
1. Process land cover data.
2. Integrate datasets and methods to assess bioenergy potentials and key nexus indicators.
3. Compare FAO statistics with ESA CCI-LC.

Custom code is memory intensive, and has been run on a server with 1 TB RAM.

Processed datasets are obtainable as referenced in the article (url: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-020-00680-5).

See individual readme files for further information.
