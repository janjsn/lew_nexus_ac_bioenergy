Quantifies bioenergy potentials, and associated land and energy water use on recently abandoned cropland.

Settings, input filenames and input variable names are defined in: 
 - Main namelist file: InputData/namelist_Input.m --> netcdf filenames, variables ++
 - Input excel file for GAEZ crop data, 'GAEZ maps/Input/Import GAEZ files.xlsx' --> GAEZ data

Run main_integration.m after correctly mapping input files. Produces results to memory.
